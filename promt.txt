You are an autonomous coding agent. 
Your task: Build and deploy the full “zerobyte.sh” website to GitHub Pages automatically.
Act as a senior full-stack engineer. Execute everything using shell commands and write all required files.

=====================
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
=====================
• Brand name: zerobyte.sh
• Theme: dark, hacker-aesthetic, elegant minimalism
• Core concept: “0 byte / empty state / void meets computation”
• Persona: digital craftsman, system tinkerer, backend + AI research vibe
• Goal of the site: personal landing page + portfolio gateway + contact hub

=====================
REQUIREMENTS
=====================
1. Create a complete website with:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js (minimal)
   - favicon (generated via SVG)
   - /assets folder (for future expansion)

2. Design language:
   - Dark mode only
   - Black (#000), charcoal (#0A0A0A), purple neon (#A259FF), cyan accent (#4FC3F7)
   - Typography: JetBrains Mono, Inter
   - Style: terminal chic + modern flat aesthetic
   - Include a floating terminal-style header with the text:
         zerobyte.sh — where the void computes itself.

3. Content layout:
   - Section 1: Hero title “0BYTE”
   - Subtitle: “Minimal presence. Maximum intent.”
   - Animated typing effect showing:
         `systems / ai / automation / devtools`
   - Section 2: Short bio (simple, clean, no cringe):
         “I build lightweight systems, explore digital primitives, 
          and craft tools that reshape how people think and work.”
   - Section 3: Portfolio slots (3 cards, placeholder links)
   - Section 4: Contact:
         Instagram @zerobyte.sh
         Email link: mailto:zerobyte.dev@gmail.com

4. Include this special SVG logo:
   - Circular glyph.
   - Inside: number “0”.
   - Below the circle: a tiny “.sh”.
   - Minimal, geometric, mono-stroke.

5. The site must be responsive and extremely lightweight (<50KB total).

6. After generating files, execute:
   - git init
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "init zerobyte.sh site"
   - create branch `main`
   - git remote add origin https://github.com/muhammad-robitulloh/zerobyte.git
   - git push -u origin main

7. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Source: main branch → / (root)
   - Output final URL after deployment.

=====================
DELIVERABLE FORMAT
=====================
1. First: generate all project files with `---- file start ----` blocks.
2. Second: print EXACT terminal commands to create these files in my environment.
3. Third: ask me for my GitHub repo URL to complete deployment steps.
4. Fourth: after I provide URL, proceed with the git steps + GitHub Pages setup.

=====================
BEGIN NOW.
